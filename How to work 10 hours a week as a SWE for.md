How to work 10 hours a week as a SWE for 7 years for $400:

1) Engineering estimates are so fuzzy and the org so broad thats not really used as the measure of productivity. 

2) For flat teams 12 per manager - 70 per skip, at a company without micromanagement, if your manager is too busy to know exaztly what your day to day is, it's easy to pass off slow work as challenging work. 

3) It helps when your manager has a disconnect stopping them from fully understanding your work. Are they a PhD who mainly reads ML research papers and worked on ML theory, doesn't code (never really did) and only works on cross team collaborations with other managers, and doesn't have a good idea of the part of the code base you work in?

4) A lot of work is ML modeling based, and requires experiments that may or may not pan out, not launching is a presumed risk of any experiment, plus many ML/data analysis/investoigatory work doesn't require checking in much code /  document trail of "artifacts". 

5) The promo system rewards "impact" and "complexity" and "leadership", which is easier to claim when you were the sole owner of the project, so many projects are designed to be highly independent so often your teammares don't know anything about your work. 

6) Given the old promo system and quid pro quo solicitation of performance feedback, everyone's too scared to give anyone else negative feedback at the peer level.  Why would you give critical feedback to someone (which they can read after), when you'll need to get a peer reference from them? And given how little they know, if you are nice and help them with their bugs / reviews quickly (or just rubber stamp), they often mistake that for you doing a good job at your own job. 

7) At the manger/calibration committee level, if your manager doesn't even know what you're doing, the other managers have no clue whatsoever. So given only positive feedback + clueless managere -> mangers arguing calibration with their gut instinct. So your manager feeling you're smart can be enoough. Plus your manager is incentivized to argue for you since having a low performer looks poorly for them. 

8) Managers pre-bucket all employees into say bottom 5%, and those going up for promo ... 






New Problems with GH Culture: 
1) There is far too much micromanagement at a level that is disruptive and distracting from the important and critical tasks at hand. This translates into an almost constant checking in with resources, almost to the degree that they feel like they are not trusted. This can best be described as a nearly constant barrage of teams direct messages and text messages when not active on teams. Trust is how the managers define trust and everybody must live by it or they will be "coached".  Their definition of trust means communicating in 15 to 30 minute intervals throughout the day. And if one doesn't respond, no matter how important what they are doing is, or how critical that moment of concentration is, there is a feeling of disappointment and lose of trust. What is worse is that the manager then shares this with your peers or those in cross functional roles. So then that gets passed on to other individuals who will later call you and scold you for being frustrating to your manager. They (this is your peer) will say things like "Hey man, I'm not your boss, but if you don't start getting back to your boss quicker (like within a microsecond timeframe) it will not be good for you. I mean I am not your boss, but if I were you I would overcommunicate. We encourage overcommunication".  Granted this is coming from a cross-functional member that is likened to your peer, giving you this warning. The culture just starts to deteriorate from there. You feel like you are no longer trusted and the expectations are more about meeting some self-imposed expectation of trust through more communication and process improvement than they are about building better software, being efficient with your time, resolving x number of bugs for the client in a quick timeframe.   

2) Management doesnt have a clue what the developers are actually doing in the code and what challenges and steps need to be made to accomplish the tasks at an optimal and accurate level. Much less do they even understand why the work needs to be done from a business perspective in some cases.  I am shocked that they know very little about our systems, much less even answer a simple question about how one of our applications or core processes worked. Where the developers have to explain to the manager the business reasons behind what they are working on. It didnt used to be like this. If anything the managers told the developers what needed to be changed and why, not the other way around. And in the past, they would even know the best approach and recommend it. That's hardly the case now, as the managers grow more and more out of touch with the changing requirements and the changing technology. They function as part of a calibration committee that doesnt really know what you do in your day to day. They have a 10k foot view at best of what the different applications are and how they work. Many times they don't even understand the high level concepts of the technologies used in the org. This hurts the culture since we used to have managers that were knowledgeable about the technology used and were sometimes involved at the architectural design and solution level and even at the coding level to some degree. This built trust and comradery with the developers and there was a level of respect and understanding from both sides. That part of the culture has started to fade gradually as the shared knowledge gap grows ever so wider between managers and developers. 

3) In the spirit of trying to "improve" processes, they put more emphasis on burndown reports and delivering more accurate LOEs than they do the improvement of the software. We are labeling ourselves as a "FinTech" when we are spending 50% or more of our time as developers in meetings and following processes. When developers first started at GH, they loved the culture. It wasnt all about being an agile expert and how we could satisfy some daily report. The process of development was built on passion for what you do and doing it well. It wasn't perfect, but there was a hunger and an excitment to do the best job you possibly can, to learn and invent new patterns, to build something from nothing. That is what made developers want to pour their hearts into it and there was a pride in the work, that was often admired by their peers and noticed by the leadership team. They loved coming to work and took great pride in their work. But sadly this has started to fade away as more meetings, more communication, and more processes take precendence and deteriorate their long established systems and routines for building good, reliable software. 

4) Can they actually deeeply read and understand everyone's CL, design docs, bugs, design challenges to truly understand the complexity and hard work? Nope. And every manager is biased and thier reports are performing better than other managers reports, it's too subjective, so how do they break the tie amonst themselves? Do they use objective numbers like revenue? Nope, they argue that can be biased per team. So what do they use? They use *artifacts*. 

5) You're not actually evaluated on if you worked hard, you're evaluated on if you made it look like you worked hard.  Consistent churn will always look more impressive than inconsistent excellence. 

6) Your job is not really to write good code for the company or increase company revenue, though that may happen incidentally sometimes.  It's really to construct an array of artifacts that look impressive to the bosses upon a cursory glance.

Pro Tips: 
- Split all bugs into multiple subtasks, its more immpressive when your 5 line CL fixes 5 issues! Or at least list them out in a bullet point list in the PR. 
- Be sure to add copious notes and screenshots to your ticket. This increases the Vertical Scroll of the bug ticket and looks like a ton more work was done. And therefore at cursory glance shows the complexity of the problems you are solving!
-  When writing design docs or tech specs, first split your work into multiple confluence pages with a plethora of code examples. Second, copy 90% of what you put into the design doc into the Jira tickets to really make a splash.
